## 1. Introduction
Introduction to your topic and question(s) (1/2-1 page)

## 2. Motivating the question(s)
Motivation for your question(s) based on course syllabus and self-chosen litterature on 'state-of-the-art' (1/2-1 page)

## 3. Overall method-plan
Your overall method-plan (research design) as well as an overview of key points/findings (1/2-1 page)

## 4. Key actors and their interaction (behaviour)
In this section of your assignment you present your findings and reflections on key actors and their interactions (3-3.5 pages). It should include:
* ### Account of method practice
  What you did using methods in combination in order to ground this part of your analysis, and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. grounded knowledge on patterns of interaction (behaviour) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus
  
## 5. Key social relations (networks)
In this section of your assignment you present your findings and reflections on key social relations. Note that this part is on both the manual 
and the automated network (3-3.5 pages). It should include:
* ### Account of method practice
  What you did using methods in combination in order to ground this part of your analysis, and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. key patterns of social relations (interactions) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus
  
## 6. Key semantic/discursive patterns (ideas)
In this section of your assigntment you present your findings and reflections on key semantic/discursive patterns (3-3.5 pages). It should include: 
* ### Account of method practice
  What you did using methods in combination in order to ground this part of your analysis, and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. key patterns of semantics/discourses (ideas) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus

## 7. Advanced Social Data Science II
This the ASDSII part of your assignment. It should be 5-6.25 pages depending on group size. 

## 8. Quali-quantitative integrations across methods
This is quali-quantitative integration section of your assignment (2-3 pages). It should include:
* Account of the interplay between the three DM-methods: Where do they support each other? Where do they lead to divergent interpretations or present gaps in knowledge?
* Brief reflection on the ASDSII part: What does it contribute to the overall project? Where do the different approaches to analysing data differ most?
* Overall methodological considerations: What quality criteria do you consider most relevant for your project (i.e. how should we assess the knowledge produced)? Draw on the syllabus. 

## 9. Discussion/Conclusion
The discussion/conclusion. Here you reiterate key findings, state the most important follow-up question this raises, and make your concluding remarks (1/2-1 page)

## 10. Appendix
You can include plots, tables, code, or other things you find relevant in the appendix. You can write it directly into your .md-file or put it in your repo and link to it here.
