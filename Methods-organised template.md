## 1. Introduction

## 2. Motivating the question(s)
Motivation for your question(s) based on course syllabus and self-chosen litterature on 'state-of-the-art' (1/2-1 page)

## 3. Overall method-plan
Your overall method-plan (research design) as well as an overview of key points/findings (1/2-1 page)

## 4. Netnography
This is the netnography part of your assignment (3-3.5 pages). It should include:
* ### Account of practice
  What you did and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. grounded knowledge on patterns of interaction (behaviour) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus
  
## 5. Visual/exploratory network analysis
This is the visual/exploratory network part of your assigntment. Note that this part is on both the manual and the automated network (3-3.5 pages). 
It should include:
* ### Account of practice
  What you did and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. key patterns of social relations (interactions) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus
  
## 6. Content analysis
This is the content analysis part of your assigntment (3-3.5 pages). It should include: 
* ### Account of practice
  What you did and justification of key choices vis-à-vis the syllabus
* ### Main analyses
  Your main analyses and key findings, i.e. key patterns of semantics/discourses (ideas) in the field 
* ### Discussions 
  Discussions of shortcomings, points of improvement, and next steps vis-à-vis quality criteria in the syllabus

## 7. Advanved Social Data Science II
This the ASDSII part of your assignment. It should be 5-6.25 pages depending on group size. 

## 8. Quali-quantitative integrations across methods
This is quali-quantitative integration section of your assignment (2-3 pages). It should include:
* Account of the interplay between the three DM-methods: Where do they support each other? Where do they lead to divergent interpretations or present gaps in knowledge?
* Brief reflection on the ASDSII part: What does it contribute to the overall project? Where do the different approaches to analysing data differ most?
* Overall methodological considerations: What quality criteria do you consider most relevant for your project (i.e. how should we assess the knowledge produced)? Draw on the syllabus. 

## 9. Discussion/Conclusion
The discussion/conclusion. Here you reiterate key findings, state the most important follow-up question this raises, and make your concluding remarks (1/2-1 page)

## 10. Appendix
You can include plots, tables, code, or other things you find relevant in the appendix. You can write it directly into your .md-file or put it in your repo and link to it here.
